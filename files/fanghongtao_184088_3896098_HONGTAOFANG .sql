--- 4. (18 points) Display the transaction location and the average transaction

--- NOTE: for cleaner display, you can (but do not need to do so) CAST a real 
---    number to display with a limited number of decimal places; 
---    e.g. CAST (AVG(value) AS NUMBER(*,2)) 
SELECT T.TRANSACTION ,CAST 
(AVG(T.ACCNUMBER AS NUMBER(*2)
FROM TRANSACTION T
GROUP BY T.TRANSACTION
HAVING AVG.T.TRANSACTION>
(SELECT AVG(T.TRANSACTION)
FROM ACCOUNT T
WHERE
